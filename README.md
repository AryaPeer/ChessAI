# Chess AI
Welcome to Chess AI, a user-friendly web-based chess application that enables you to test your chess skills against a computer opponent. This repository contains the entire codebase for the game and the computer's logic. If you're ready for a game, simply head over to the github pages site and enjoy playing against my bot.

This Chess AI uses a Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the computer's moves and gets evaluation values from a REST API.
